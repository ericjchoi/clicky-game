# Clicky Game

## Overview

This app is a clicking game developed with React. User gets score if previously un-clicked picture is clicked. If the user clicks the picture that already clicked before, game resets current score to 0 but top score remains the same. When the top score record is broken, the top score will be updated together with score. After achieving the maximum top score of 12, game will be reset after the following click. Then the new game starts. Incorrect clicking will cause the pictures shaken. Each click will cause shuffling the pictures.
